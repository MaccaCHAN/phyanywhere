Physics Anywhere App is created for helping your study of physics. The scope of the content is based on the syllabus of HKDSE physics. It has a quiz of important formulae so as to help you to revise and memorize the formula anywhere, anytime.  There is also a personalized 'My Formula List' so that you can have your own list of formulae that you want to focus on. More content will be coming.
